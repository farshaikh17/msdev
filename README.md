# Prospect CRM

A single-user lead/prospect CRM that replaces the Excel prospect-tracking
workbook. It runs a four-stage pipeline — **Discovery → Screen → Triage → Verify**
— over leads, with the criteria stored as editable data, deduplication,
reconciliation of existing prospects, and an append-only audit log.

The core is generic (account, opportunity, stage, verdict), so the same app
works for sales leads, partnerships or recruiting pipelines. Every table is
scoped by `workspace_id`, so multi-tenant accounts can be added later without
rewriting the data layer.

It runs online (Vercel + a free Neon Postgres database) or on a computer.

**This tool only researches and prepares — it never acts.** It never submits
anything or contacts anyone. You approve and send outreach yourself; the app
only records that you did.

## Put it online (Vercel + free Neon database)

1. In Vercel: **Add New… → Project**, pick this GitHub repository, then **Deploy**.
   The site will say a database needs connecting. That's expected.
2. In the project: **Storage → Create Database → Neon (Postgres)**, then connect it to
   the project. This sets `DATABASE_URL` automatically.
3. **Deployments → ⋯ → Redeploy.** Every deploy sets up and upgrades the database
   automatically, before the new version goes live.
4. Open the site **right away**. The first visit asks you to create your password, and
   whoever does this first owns the app. After that, everyone must sign in.
5. Go to **Import** and upload the tracker workbook.
6. In **Rules & settings → Redaction**, add the identity terms that must never appear in
   shared exports.

The password is stored only as a salted hash, and you can change it in *Rules &
settings*. Optionally, an `APP_PASSWORD` environment variable overrides it.

## Run it on a computer (optional)

Requires Node.js 20.9+. No database install: an embedded Postgres keeps data in
`data/pglite` (gitignored).

```bash
npm install
npm run dev          # sets up the database, then serves http://localhost:3000
```

The first visit asks you to create a password, just like online. Set
`DATABASE_URL` to use a real Postgres instead of the embedded one.

### Import the workbook

Use the **Import** page in the app, or from a terminal:

```bash
npm run import -- "path/to/Local Prospect Weekly Tracker.xlsx"
```

- The import runs in a single transaction. It prints source rows vs imported
  rows for each sheet, and checks them against the counts in the workbook's own
  CONFIG › MIGRATION VALIDATION block. If anything doesn't match, nothing is
  written.
- Every source row is kept verbatim in `import_rows` and linked to the record it
  became.
- Importing the same file twice is refused, unless you choose to import it again
  anyway.
- Keep the workbook **out of the repo**. `*.xlsx` is gitignored, except for the
  placeholder test fixture.

| Sheet | Becomes |
|---|---|
| RAW LEADS | Records, with stage 1/2/2.5/3 verdict + reason pairs. Stage and status are derived from the verdicts. Other columns become criteria attributes. |
| PRIORITY | Records at Verify / active, with tier, prepared brief/answers and outreach status. |
| HOLD / ARCHIVE | Record status `hold` / `archived`, with reason, date and next action. |
| TARGET ACCOUNTS | Target accounts. Both the outreach and watchlist blocks are imported, and contacts go into restricted fields. |
| HISTORY | History entries. Both the reconciliation and activity-log blocks are imported, linked to records where they match. |
| CONFIG (hidden) | Rules: criteria, exclusions, stage definitions, standing and trigger rules. Also settings: profile, sheet/column maps, validation counts. |

A lead that appears on several sheets is **one** record. It is deduplicated on
(account, opportunity, source/next-step URL), and the later sheet sets its
current state (RAW → PRIORITY → HOLD → ARCHIVE).

### Redaction terms (keep private)

Enter the owner's name, personal email/phone, profile URL, home city and
current employer in *Rules & settings → Redaction*. They are redacted from
**shared** exports. When running on a computer, you can instead copy
`config/identity.example.json` to `data/identity.local.json` (gitignored); it is
loaded on every start.

## Using it

- **Find new leads** (Home, or the *Find leads* page) searches the public job
  boards (Lever, Greenhouse, Ashby, Workable, Recruitee, SmartRecruiters) of
  every company in your tracker, plus any careers link you add. It is free: no
  API key, no AI. It:
  1. Checks whether each active or held lead's listing is still on its board
     (sets *Verified open* and the source verification).
  2. Adds new jobs whose title matches your words, skips titles with a skip
     word, and drops jobs that fail your screen rules (on-site/hybrid, or only
     open to another region). New jobs land in **New to review**, where you
     press Yes / Not sure / No. Yes moves the job through to Ready.
  3. Reads remote-job sites (Remotive, Himalayas, Workable's job search —
     used by companies in every industry —, Jobicy, RemoteOK, Working Nomads,
     We Work Remotely) for matching jobs at companies not watched yet,
     and looks for each company's own careers board (`candidateBoards`). Only
     if that board lists the same job is it trusted: the board is watched from
     then on and its jobs are added as above, linking to the company's page.
     Unconfirmed jobs are listed on Find leads, never added; listings with scam
     warning signs (fees, WhatsApp/Telegram, crypto pay) are dropped
     (`src/sources/job-sites.ts`).
  4. Runs the weekly update below.

  It also runs by itself every Monday at 08:00 India time through Vercel Cron
  (`vercel.json` → `/api/cron/weekly`). `CRON_SECRET` must be set in Vercel
  (Settings → Environment variables); the route refuses to run without it when
  hosted. Locally, Vercel's scheduler user agent is enough.
  LinkedIn and other sites can't be searched this way. Add those leads by hand.
- **Run update** is the weekly sorting step. It replaces the workbook's
  "Update this week's prospect tracker" trigger. In one transaction it:
  1. Reconciles every existing prospect and held record against the *current*
     rules. A prospect that no longer qualifies moves to Archive (genuine
     violation) or Hold (needs review / unverified source). Qualifying once is
     not a permanent pass.
  2. Runs every pending record through Screen → Triage → Verify, applying the
     stored rules and writing a verdict + reason at each stage. Jobs waiting
     in New to review are left for you.
  3. Returns a counts-only summary (in vs out per stage, moved to Hold/Archive,
     active prospects by tier) and logs every change to History.
- **Applied** (application tracker): every list and lead has a "Your
  application" drop-down (Not applied yet → Applied → Heard back →
  Interviewing → Offer / Not successful / Withdrew). Applied leads move to the
  Applied list whatever happens to the listing; the first applied date is
  kept. Only a signed-in person can set these (`core/permissions.ts`).
- **Your AI** (`/connect`): a private link the owner adds to Claude as a custom
  connector (Model Context Protocol, `src/app/api/mcp/[key]/route.ts`). Tools
  (`src/services/ai-tools.ts`) read leads, the last search and saved answers,
  and write prepared briefs/answers, notes and new leads — never decisions,
  application statuses, rules or settings. Only a hash of the link's key is
  stored; making a new link or switching it off stops the old one.
- **My answers**: the owner's reusable application answers (intro, notice
  period, pay…), shown with Copy buttons on every Ready lead. Stored in
  settings, never exported, logged without their text.
- **Password**: change it, or make a one-time recovery code (shown once,
  stored as a hash). "Forgot your password?" on the sign-in page uses it.
- **Records**: list, filter and sort by view (Leads / Prospects / Hold /
  Archive), stage, status and tier, or search. Open a record to edit it, make
  the next stage decision (a reason is always required), hold, archive or
  restore it, mark source verification, set the tier, and record outreach
  hand-offs.
- **Rules & settings**: edit the criteria each stage applies, and whether a
  violation archives or holds. Rules are disabled, never deleted.
- **Exports**: *shared* CSV drops restricted fields (prepared packages, notes,
  contacts, gaps, unmapped columns) and scrubs identity terms, emails and phone
  numbers. *Internal* CSV is everything, for your own backups.

## Forge Demo (demo websites)

**Forge Demo** (in the top menu of the CRM) builds a one-page demo website for a local
home-services business from just its name (plus trade, city and phone if you
have them). Each demo gets:

- a public link, `/p/<demo>`, to send or open on a sales call (no sign-in; archiving a demo switches the link off);
- a link on your own GoHighLevel page, `<your page>?d=<demo>`, once that page is set up (below);
- a ready-to-paste Google Chat message and tracker-sheet row.

**Copy.** With `GEMINI_API_KEY` (a Google AI Studio key) set in the environment,
Gemini writes the copy for each business (`gemini-3.8-flash` by default; set
`GEMINI_MODEL` to change it). Without it, sites are drafted from the built-in
trade template. The AI is told to state only facts you typed
in; without real reviews, the page shows clearly-marked sample reviews.

**GoHighLevel.** Make one blank page in GoHighLevel, add a full-width Custom
JS/HTML element, and paste the code shown at the bottom of the Forge Demo page.
Save that page's address on the same screen. The page then shows whichever demo
its `?d=` names, so one GHL page serves every demo.

**Standalone app on Cloudflare (free).** `cloudflare/forge/` is Forge Demo as its own
small app on the Workers Free plan, with its demos in Cloudflare D1: sign-in with a team
password, new demo, demo list, share links, GoHighLevel setup and chat widget settings.
Claude Opus 5.5 designs each demo as a five-page website (Home, Services, About, Service
Areas, Contact) with light and dark modes in the chosen primary colour. It builds in the
background on a Cloudflare Queue: one job designs the look (styles, header, footer),
then the five pages are written side by side. The new site goes live only once every page
is written; a failed build can be retried without paying again for the pages already done.

The sites are served by a second Worker, `forge-sites`, at `/<demo>/<page>` on its own
origin, so AI-written pages can't reach the team app. Every page gets the GoHighLevel chat
widget, recoloured to the site's primary colour (set the widget in GoHighLevel setup, or
per demo under "More details"; `off` turns it off).

Deploy with `npm run forge:deploy` (applies database migrations, then deploys both Workers).
Secrets, set in Cloudflare → Workers → forge-demo → Settings → Variables and Secrets:
`FORGE_PASSWORD` (sign-in) and `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (without it, sites use the built-in
template; `CLAUDE_MODEL` overrides the model).

Code: `src/forge/` (schema, generator, template, storage), pages in `src/app/forge/`,
public routes `src/app/p/[slug]` and `src/app/api/forge/[slug]`, Cloudflare app in
`cloudflare/forge/` (shares `src/forge/` for the template and copy).

## Business rules and where they're enforced

| Rule | Enforcement |
|---|---|
| Never fabricate; unknown = `UNKNOWN` | Blank/"unknown" input is stored as UNKNOWN, and a known value is never overwritten by an unknown one (`services/records.ts`). |
| UNKNOWN doesn't auto-reject | UNKNOWN evaluates as "unknown", never "fail" (`core/rules.ts`). |
| Unverifiable sources → Hold | Verify-stage promotion requires `source = verified`; reconciliation holds unverified prospects (`core/pipeline.ts`). |
| Dedup on (account, opportunity, URL) | Unique index plus in-place update, logged as `dedup_merge`. URLs and company names are normalised (`core/dedup.ts`). |
| Reconciliation every run | `services/reconcile.ts`, called first by Run update. |
| Nothing hard-deleted; every change logged | Postgres triggers block `DELETE`/`TRUNCATE` on records, accounts and rules, and any `UPDATE`/`DELETE`/`TRUNCATE` on history (`drizzle/0001_append_only.sql`). |
| Research only, never acts | Permission layer: no send/submit capability exists; human-only outreach states need a human actor plus explicit confirmation (`core/permissions.ts`). ESLint forbids `fetch`/`http`/mail libraries in `src/`, except the read-only job-board reader `src/sources/job-boards.ts` (GET requests to public job listings only; `job-sites.ts` goes through its fetcher). |
| No identity leakage | Every exported field is classified (unclassified = restricted), and shared exports are scrubbed (`core/redaction.ts`). Contacts live only in labelled contact fields, never in the dedup key. |

### Criteria derived from CONFIG

CONFIG's rules are prose, so they're imported as process notes. The import also
adds a few **evaluable** criteria derived from them. Each one cites its source
and can be edited or disabled:

- Location confidence is not `BLOCKED` (Screen).
- Verified location fit does not start with `NO` (Verify).
- Verified open does not start with `NO` (Verify).
- Verified value doesn't say "below floor" (Verify).
- Gig/marketplace accounts (e.g. micro1) → **Hold**, not reject (Triage).

The compensation floor is **not** a numeric rule. The workbook's pay text mixes
currencies and monthly/annual periods, so applying a number would mean guessing.
It stays a note for human judgement at Verify.

## Project layout

```
src/core/       pure domain logic (no DB): rules, pipeline, dedup, permissions, redaction
src/db/         Drizzle schema + Postgres client (Neon/any Postgres online, embedded PGlite locally)
src/lib/        sign-in: first-visit password setup, scrypt hash, signed session cookie
src/proxy.ts    requires sign-in for every request
src/sources/    read-only readers for public job boards and remote-job sites (the only code allowed to go online)
src/services/   workspace-scoped persistence; every change writes History
src/app/        Next.js UI (server components + server actions) and CSV export routes
scripts/        migrate, workbook import (also used by the Import page), fixture generator
drizzle/        SQL migrations (incl. append-only triggers)
tests/          vitest: core rules, services, import (placeholder fixture only)
```

Checks: `npm test`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`.

### Team accounts

- **Owner**: created on first visit (password only; an email is optional) and
  runs the `default` workspace. The migration `0002_people.sql` moves an
  existing owner's password and recovery code into the `users` table.
- **Members**: invited from the **Team** page with a one-time link
  (`/join/<token>`, 7 days, only a SHA-256 of the token is stored). Accepting
  creates the person and a private workspace seeded with the default rules.
  They sign in with email + password.
- `src/services/request.ts` resolves the signed-in person and their workspace
  for every request; every query is scoped by `workspace_id`
  (`tests/isolation.test.ts`). The owner can open a member's workspace
  (`crm_view` cookie, owner only); changes there are recorded under the owner.
- Sessions carry the person's id and sign-out counter (`session_epoch`):
  "sign out everywhere", a password change, a password link or switching an
  account off ends that person's sessions. Recovery codes, the guessing
  throttle and AI links are per person/workspace.
- The daily cron searches every active person's workspace on Mondays (as many
  as fit in one run) and catches up missed ones on other days.
