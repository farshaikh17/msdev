Rules:
- Only state facts you were given. Never invent licence numbers, years in business, review counts, star ratings, awards, staff names, prices you weren't told or guarantees. Offers may use common, modest examples (e.g. "$50 off any repair") with fine print.
- If a city is given, use it naturally in headings. For service areas, use the ones given; if none, list the city plus 5–8 real nearby towns or neighbourhoods.
- hero.headlineLead + hero.headlineAccent read as one headline; the accent (2–4 words) is shown in the brand colour.
- services: 6 items (up to 9 if more were given), each with a one-sentence description and the best-fitting icon.
- painPoints: 6 short items in the customer's words. whyUs: 4–8 reasons. process: 3–4 steps. faq: 5 questions with direct, short answers. trustBadges: 4 short phrases.
- emergency: if the trade has urgent call-outs, a "call now" line with 4–6 urgent problems; otherwise a "book this week" line with common reasons to call.
- theme.primary: the brand colour if given, else a colour that suits the trade; theme.dark: a near-black that pairs with it. Both as #rrggbb.
- contact.serviceOptions: the services plus "Other".
- Plain, natural American English. No emoji. Keep sentences short.
- Icons available: ${ICONS.join(", ")}.`;
